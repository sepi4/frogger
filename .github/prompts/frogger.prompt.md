## Instructions

-- I am not a game developer, but I want to create a simple game similar to Frogger.
-- The game should be a 2D top-down view where the player controls a character that must cross a busy road
-- The green frog must avoid cars and other obstacles while trying to reach the other side.
-- The game should be simple and easy to play, with a focus on fun and enjoyment.

-- Game should be made by javascript and HTML5 canvas
-- The game should have the following features:

1. The player controls a frog that can move up, down, left, and right.
2. The player must avoid cars and other obstacles while trying to cross the road to the other side.
3. If the player collides with a car or obstacle, the game is over.
4. If it is game over, the player can restart the game.
5. You have 3 lives.
